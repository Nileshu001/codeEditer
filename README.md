# Code Editor

## Overview
This project is a basic web-based simple code editor created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code editor allows users to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate input sections and view the live output in an iframe. It also features copy and lock/unlock buttons function.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the code editor.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the code editor and defining its layout.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the code editor's functionality, live updating, and button actions.

## Features
- Three separate input sections for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- Live preview of the code in an iframe.
- Copy button to easily copy the code to the clipboard.
- Lock/Unlock button to disable or enable code editing.
- Basic indentation for code readability.
